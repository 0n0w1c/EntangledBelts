#### Entangled Belts - Clones the underground belts, useful for belt braiding.  
Up for the "No Long-handed Inserter Challenge"?

With Entangled Belts, you can braid with same-speed underground belts.  
Simply alternate between pairs of underground belts and entangled belts.  

Entangled belts are crafted from underground belts and revert when mined.  

Startup option to enable the *No Long-handed Inserter Challenge*,  
the most coveted of all achievements... well, maybe not the most.  

Compatible with most mods that modify or add underground belts.  

Note: If Bob's Logistics and the inserter overhaul is active, the challenge option will be ignored.
